# Summary/Abstract

The time required to travel to healthcare facilities can affect how often people receive. Longer travel times may lead to adverse health outcomes, such as higher BMI. It may also change an individual's perception of their own health status [@kellyAreDifferencesTravel2016].

# Introduction

## General Background Information

Fourteen people were included in this study. Their height, weight, and gender were recorded during their interview. The participants were asked how long (in minutes) it takes takes to travel to the nearest healthcare facility from their home. The participants were also asked to rate their health from using poor, fair, good, excellent.

## Description of data and data source

Fourteen people were included in this study. Their height, weight, and gender were recorded during their interview. The participants were asked how long (in minutes) it takes takes to travel to the nearest healthcare facility from their home. The participants were also asked to rate their health from using poor, fair, good, excellent.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

Does travel time to access healthcare affect health outcomes, such as weight, and alter a person's perception of their own health status?

An example of a similar study can he found in [@kellyAreDifferencesTravel2016].

# Methods

 <!--*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*-->

## Data aquisition
Data was collected during in-person interviews with 14 people. Interview responses were entered into an Excel spreadsheet by multiple study employees. 


## Data import and cleaning
Data was cleaned using R code. Records that fell outside of defined parameters were removed. Of the 14 orginal records, 9 remained after cleaning


## Statistical analysis

Simple scatter and box plots were used to plots visualize the data. Descriptive tables were created. Finally, linear models were generated in R using the ggplot2 package.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

View the tables and figures below for a better understanding of the data. 

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

<!-- Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**-->

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable2.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

<!--*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid.*-->

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

<!--*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here.*-->

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

In this study, there were no statistically significant relationships between travel time to the nearest healthcare facility and

## Strengths and Limitations

Given the small sample size, the results are not generalizable to any population. A larger sample size would be needed for more reliable results.
Weight is not a proxy for health and it is the only health outcome included in this study.

## Conclusions

Travel time to access healthcare has been demonstrated in other studies as a factor that can lead to adverse health outcomes. Larger sample sizes and better data collection and input methods could help to illustrate the relationship. 

<!--*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.-->

# Appendix 1

## Scatter plot 1
```{r}
#| label: fig-result1
#| fig-cap: "Travel time to access healthcare by weight -stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","HC_time_by_Weight_stratified.png"))
```

## Box plot 1

```{r}
#| label: fig-result2
#| fig-cap: "Weight by self-reported health status."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","Weight_by_SR_health.png"))
```



```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table 3."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```
In this linear model, none of the relationships are statistically significant at alpha = 0.05.
